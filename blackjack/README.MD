## Game creates a new Deck
## Deck calls the card class 52 times to create all 52 card combinations then shuffles them
## Game calls Dealer / House to play the round
## Players bet
## Dealer / House deals initial 2 cards to each Hand (dealer has one card not showing)
## Hand class handles busts / blackjack
## After hand is checked dealer asks player if they would like to hit till they stand then repeats for next player
## Dealer hits until hand >= 16
## If bust payout all players who didnt bust
## If dealer didnt bust payout those that have higher score (& not busted) and take from those who have lower score.
